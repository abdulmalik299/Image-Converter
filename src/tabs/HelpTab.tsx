            <p className="mt-1">
              JPG cannot store transparency. Transparent pixels must become a solid color. Use the JPG background setting.

            <p className="mt-1">
              Raster images are pixels. SVG is shapes. Tracing guesses shapes from pixels. Logos can be very close; photos may become huge.
